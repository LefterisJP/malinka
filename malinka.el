;;; Commentary:
;; Malinka is a project management Emacs package for C/C++
;;
;; It uses rtags to help the user jump around the code easily and without the
;; mistaken tag jumping that other taggers frequently have with C/C++ code.
;; The main functionality of malinka is to properly populate and communicate the
;; compiler commands to the rtags daemons depending on the project you are working
;; on.
;;
;; Optionally and if you also have flycheck with the clang syntax-checker activated
;; malinka will communicate to flycheck's clang syntax checker the appropriate
;; cpp-defines and include paths so that flycheck can do its syntax checking.
;;
;; The way to define a project is by using `malinka-define-project' and to provide
;; the basic attributes that a project needs.  For more information you can read
;; the function's docstring and the readme file.  For a quick introduction you can
;; visit this blog post http://blog.refu.co/?p=1311

;;; --- Customizable variables ---
(defcustom malinka-completion-system nil
  "The completion system to use.

Inspired by flycheck's choice of completion system.
Docstrings are also taken from there.

`ido'
     Use IDO.

     IDO is a built-in alternative completion system, without
     good flex matching and a powerful UI.  You may want to
     install flx-ido (see URL `https://github.com/lewang/flx') to
     improve the flex matching in IDO.

nil
     Use the standard unfancy `completing-read'.

     `completing-read' has a very simple and primitive UI, and
     does not offer flex matching.  This is the default setting,
     though, to match Emacs' defaults.  With this system, you may
     want enable option `icomplete-mode' to improve the display
     of completion candidates at least."

Provide a list of strings in CPP-DEFINES for the cpp defines used by
the project.

In COMPILER-FLAGS provide arguments that should be passed to the compiler

Provide a list of strings in INCLUDE-DIRS for the include paths used by
this project.

Provide the ROOT-DIRECTORY of the project

If SAME-NAME-CHECK is non nil then even if a file of the same project is visited
the c/c++ configuration will be regenerated. If `same-name-check' is non nil
 then even if a file of the same project is visited the c/c++ configuration
 will be regenerated. That is useful in situations where multiple versions
  of a project exist in different directories.

Having `same-name-check' nil in those cases allows us to simultaneously develop on
the different versions of the project which reside in the different directories and
keep different defines and include directories for each. Be default it is set to
true.

The project is added to the global `malinka-projects-map'
